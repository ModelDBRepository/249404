            The author's version is available at
            <a href="http://modeldb.yale.edu/136715">http://modeldb.yale.edu/136715</a>.

            The main differences are:
            <ul>
                <li>The original was implemented mostly using NEURON's gui tools with a little HOC; this version is implemented in a Python script for NEURON.</li>
                <li>The original uses a MOD file to handle sodium accumulation and diffusion; this version use NEURON's reaction-diffusion support.</li>
                <li>The original has two additional simulations using a reduced model with no dendrites.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Two of the three mod files used (<tt>kv</tt>, <tt>Kv1</tt>) have been retained unmodified from the author's version.
            The third, <tt>nacurrent</tt> is a simplified version of the original author's <tt>hh_Cs_scaled</tt> after removing the 
            potassium and leak currents from that file which are not used in this model. The name has been changed to deemphasize the file's historical connection to <tt>hh.mod</tt> as the temperature dependence and rate functions are not intended to be appropriate for modeling a squid.
        </p>
        <p>
            To run, compile the mod files in this directory (on Linux or Mac by changing to this directory and typing <tt>nrnivmodl</tt>; on Windows by dragging this folder to the <tt>mknrndll</tt> icon), then run <tt>mosinit.py</tt> via either:<br/>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python -i mosinit.py</tt><br/>
            or<br/>
            <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python3 -i mosinit.py</tt><br/>
            depending on your Python setup. Choose either "Fig 3A" or "Fig 6B" from the popup, and click "Init &amp; Run". When the simulations complete you should see the respective images below:
